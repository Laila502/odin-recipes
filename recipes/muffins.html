    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/4 cups (160g) whole wheat pastry flour or all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (48g) unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt</li>
            <li>3/4 cup (180g) dairy-free semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>
            <li>3/4 cup (180g) full-fat coconut milk</li>
            <li>3/4 cup (240g) pure maple syrup</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (120g) unsweetened applesauce</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoon (8g) vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat an oven to 350°F (177°C and line a muffin pan with 12 nonstick liners</li>
            <li>Add the wheat flour, cocoa powder, baking soda and salt to a large bowl and whisk very well. Add the milk, applesauce, vanilla and chocolate chips and stir until the batter is smooth.</li>
            <li>Bake for 22-25 minutes. They are done when they have puffed up and a toothpick comes out basically clean. Don't be confused between wet batter and the melted chocolate chips though.</li>
            <li>Let them cool for 15 minutes, as they will finish cooking and be too tender to eat right away. Cool completely on a wire rack. Once cooled, drizzle chocolate sauce on top if feeling super indulgent.</li>
        </ol>
